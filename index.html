                <h2>Hello World(6.30.2016)</h2>
                <p>
                    Aright everyone, welcome to my blog. 
                    <br><br>
                    What you see here is a 
                    real rough web layout that I just whipped up based of another 
                    website that I threw together for computer science class maybe
                    a year or two ago. I have since then nearly forgotten basically
                    everything about html and css. Needless to say, there was much
                    copy-pasting from past files to here. Anyway, this crude design
                    is fine, as all it needs to be is functional. I'll probably
                    try to improve the aesthetics sometime in the future. I've 
                    already put off making this first blog post for a while now.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of the blog, I've made a goal to myself to get my
                    life in order. Pretty much for the past year (or all of 
                    high-school even), I've pretty much slacked super hard and have
                    just been going through my academics with just about absolute
                    lack of motivation. I've always thought that working with 
                    software was the career path for me and working in school was
                    just the robotic procedure for me to achieve that goal. Despite
                    me taking the prerequisite courses and getting the "recommended"
                    marks in them, I haven't really gone out of my way to learn
                    more about software development and coding. I guess I never 
                    really felt the pressure from my lack of solid knowledge on 
                    software development and simply relied on the computer 
                    programming courses at my high school to completely teach me 
                    everything I need to know. Now I'm sitting in front of my
                    computer screen, just a little more than a day after my graduation
                    ceremony. I've had this nagging feeling that's been growing
                    stronger as every day passes. I feel like despite me being 
                    offered-and accepting-admission into Software Engineering at 
                    the University of Waterloo, I completely lack the foundational 
                    knowledge and experience to succeed in the program. 
                    <br><br>
                    And so the idea of this blog came to be. I would document the 
                    events prior to and during my time in university as a memoir
                    to look back on, and maybe even serve as a resource to future
                    aspiring students that intend to follow the same path. At the
                    same time, I would continually develop this website as a way
                    of learning more about front and back end website development.
                    <br><br>
                    And here it is. I wanted this post to be a introduction of 
                    sorts but it just kind of devolved into some sort of rambling
                    that dragged on longer than I intended. Just wanted to get 
                    something done before I procrastinate myself past the point
                    of no return.
