                    <p>
                        It's been a little less than a month since I made a post
                        but hardly anything has happened.
                        <br><br>
                        I've just been taking the little "intro to web development"
                        course on the Codecademy website on the side just to get
                        a refresher on the basics of front end stuff. But to be
                        honest, I've been putting off to play more video games.
                        Overwatch has been pretty much the only thing I've been
                        doing in the past week since I quit my job. In hindsight,
                        I had lots of time learn things as well even when I had
                        a job as I only worked part time. Preeeetty sure that this lack
                        of productivity is going to come back and bite me in the 
                        ass later.

                        Residence has been assigned by the uWaterloo about a week
                        ago. Though I registered for residence with 3 other people
                        together AND we all collectively selected the same
                        residence priority choices, we still managed to get our
                        last choice...CLV. Though I don't have anything against 
                        CLV, it's literally on the complete other side of campus.
                        It's so far, it offers its own shuttle service to campus.
                        Regardless, we don't really have any choice but to accept
                        it, so tough luck. Software Engineering doesn't offer
                        electives first year, so I don't really have to worry about 
                        that. Hack the North registration is just ending and I've
                        got a couple of responses for teammates in the SE Facebook
                        group. Hopefully we'll get in so I can get steamrolled
                        already.

                        As for this website, pretty much nothing has changed.
                        The things that I have relearned from Codecademy is hardly
                        anything more than what I've already used for the layout
                        that you see here. And, if it works it's fine right?
                        I probably need to find a way to allow text input directly
                        from the website for better convenience. Right now I've 
                        been using the really ghetto method of writing out the 
                        entire blog post right in the HTML editor, which has the
                        added crude-ness of me not knowing how to enable text wrap
                        and manually pressing ENTER every time I'm running out of 
                        screen space. Of course, that doesn't translate to a new
                        on the actual website but the text wraps fine once it's 
                        on the page.
                        <br><br>
                        Anyways, this post has been getting pretty lengthy and 
                        I've been typing this up from the front seat of my
                        family's car, as we travel down the 400. For the next
                        3 weeks, we'll be heading across the US to Yellowstone 
                        and the Grand Canyon. Once again, I'll put off prelearning
                        all material that would help me at Waterloo. Feelsbadman.

                    <h2>Hello World (6.30.2016)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aright everyone, welcome to my blog. 
                        <br><br>
                        What you see here is a 
                        real rough web layout that I just whipped up based of another 
                        website that I threw together for computer science class maybe
                        a year or two ago. I have since then nearly forgotten basically
                        everything about html and css. Needless to say, there was much
                        copy-pasting from past files to here. Anyway, this crude design
                        is fine, as all it needs to be is functional. I'll probably
                        try to improve the aesthetics sometime in the future. I've 
                        already put off making this first blog post for a while now.
                        <br><br>
                        Speaking of the blog, I've made a goal to myself to get my
                        life in order. Pretty much for the past year (or all of 
                        high-school even), I've pretty much slacked super hard and have
                        just been going through my academics with just about absolute
                        lack of motivation. I've always thought that working with 
                        software was the career path for me and working in school was
                        just the robotic procedure for me to achieve that goal. Despite
                        me taking the prerequisite courses and getting the "recommended"
                        marks in them, I haven't really gone out of my way to learn
                        more about software development and coding. I guess I never 
                        really felt the pressure from my lack of solid knowledge on 
                        software development and simply relied on the computer 
                        programming courses at my high school to completely teach me 
                        everything I need to know. Now I'm sitting in front of my
                        computer screen, just a little more than a day after my graduation
                        ceremony. I've had this nagging feeling that's been growing
                        stronger as every day passes. I feel like despite me being 
                        offered-and accepting-admission into Software Engineering at 
                        the University of Waterloo, I still lack the foundational 
                        knowledge and experience to succeed in the program. 
                        <br><br>
                        And so the idea of this blog came to be. I would document the 
                        events prior to and during my time in university as a memoir
                        to look back on, and maybe even serve as a resource to future
                        aspiring students that intend to follow the same path. At the
                        same time, I would continually develop this website as a way
                        of learning more about front and back end website development.
                        <br><br>
                        And here it is. I wanted this post to be a introduction of 
                        sorts but it just kind of devolved into some sort of rambling
                        that dragged on longer than I intended. Just wanted to get 
                        something done before I procrastinate myself past the point
                        of no return.
