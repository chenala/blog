                    <p>Ooookay, well nothing of note really happened this month.</p>
                    <p>I've been home for a couple weeks now; the road trip was cut short by a couple days since we couldn't really find anything meaningful to do in that time period. This is probably going to be the last road trip that I'm going to have for a while. I don't foresee myself having bucket-loads of free time in the coming years. It was fun while it lasted at least, despite that fact that half the road trip actually road. Just endless stretches of road for as far as the eye can see. Though I never get tired of driving, it does get fairly boring at times.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, there's only a week until the move-in date for residence at Waterloo, haven't started packing yet. Some of my roommates and I went down to the dollar store to go buy some things, mainly just kitchen stuff and cleaning supplies (broom, dustpan, plastic food containers, etc).  Really haven't lived completely independently at all so I'm not really to sure of what kind of things to bring beforehand other than the basics. For now, clothes, computers, bathroom stuff, and dining stuff should suffice; the rest of the things we'll just buy once we arrive.</p>
                    <p>Nothing too much else to talk about actually, I paid for the rest of my tuition that wasn't covered by OSAP and scholarships, and looked at some of the courses that I will be taking once 1A term comes. If I remember correctly, the number of hours of class every week is about 28 or so with the earliest class being 8:30AM and the latest ones ending around 5:00 PM. None of the professors seem to have terrible reviews on RateMyProf so hopefully all goes well.</p>
                    <p>And in terms of this website development, I've pretty rewrote the entire blog to incorporate bootstrap so I don't have to worry about spacing and element placement that much. The design is far from complete, and is still largely based off of the template provide by Netbeans anyway so I still have much to work on. Probably the next steps for finishing this site is to change the layout, color scheme, other front end stuff to make it look more appealing. Additionally I'm still typing straight in to the text editor (but I have soft text wrapping now woohoo) so finding some way to allow blog post creation on-site would be great, and finding some way to store the blog posts in a database off Github couldn't hurt either.</p>
                    <p>That's just about all I can think of to write for this post, hopefully as the university term starts I'll find some more stuff to write about and even learn how to make this site not look like a piece of garbage. </p>

                    <p>It's been a little less than a month since I made a post but hardly anything has happened. </p>
                    <p>I've just been taking the little "intro to web development" course on the Codecademy website on the side just to get a refresher on the basics of front end stuff. But to be honest, I've been putting off to play more video games. Overwatch has been pretty much the only thing I've been doing in the past week since I quit my job. In hindsight, I had lots of time learn things as well even when I had a job as I only worked part time. Preeeetty sure that this lack of productivity is going to come back and bite me in the ass later. </p>
                    <p>Residence has been assigned by the uWaterloo about a week ago. Though I registered for residence with 3 other people together AND we all collectively selected the same residence priority choices, we still managed to get our last choice...CLV. Though I don't have anything against CLV, it's literally on the complete other side of campus. It's so far, it offers its own shuttle service to campus. Regardless, we don't really have any choice but to accept it, so tough luck. Software Engineering doesn't offer electives first year, so I don't really have to worry about that. Hack the North registration is just ending and I've got a couple of responses for teammates in the SE Facebook group. Hopefully we'll get in so I can get steamrolled already. </p>
                    <p>As for this website, pretty much nothing has changed. The things that I have relearned from Codecademy is hardly anything more than what I've already used for the layout that you see here. And, if it works it's fine right? I probably need to find a way to allow text input directly from the website for better convenience. Right now I've been using the really ghetto method of writing out the entire blog post right in the HTML editor, which has the added crude-ness of me not knowing how to enable text wrap and manually pressing ENTER every time I'm running out of screen space. Of course, that doesn't translate to a new on the actual website but the text wraps fine once it's on the page. </p>
                    <p>Anyways, this post has been getting pretty lengthy and I've been typing this up from the front seat of my family's car, as we travel down the 400. For the next 3 weeks, we'll be heading across the US to Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. Once again, I'll put off prelearning all material that would help me at Waterloo. Feelsbadman.</p>

                    <h2>Hello World (6.30.2016)</h2>
                    <p>Aright everyone, welcome to my blog. </p>
                    <p>What you see here is a real rough web layout that I just whipped up based of another website that I threw together for computer science class maybe a year or two ago. I have since then nearly forgotten basically everything about html and css. Needless to say, there was much copy-pasting from past files to here. Anyway, this crude design is fine, as all it needs to be is functional. I'll probably try to improve the aesthetics sometime in the future. I've already put off making this first blog post for a while now.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of the blog, I've made a goal to myself to get my life in order. Pretty much for the past year (or all of high-school even), I've pretty much slacked super hard and have just been going through my academics with just about absolute lack of motivation. I've always thought that working with software was the career path for me and working in school was just the robotic procedure for me to achieve that goal. Despite me taking the prerequisite courses and getting the "recommended" marks in them, I haven't really gone out of my way to learn more about software development and coding. I guess I never really felt the pressure from my lack of solid knowledge on software development and simply relied on the computer programming courses at my high school to completely teach me everything I need to know. Now I'm sitting in front of my computer screen, just a little more than a day after my graduation ceremony. I've had this nagging feeling that's been growing stronger as every day passes. I feel like despite me being offered-and accepting-admission into Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I still lack the foundational knowledge and experience to succeed in the program. </p>
                    <p>And so the idea of this blog came to be. I would document the events prior to and during my time in university as a memoir to look back on, and maybe even serve as a resource to future aspiring students that intend to follow the same path. At the same time, I would continually develop this website as a way of learning more about front and back end website development. </p>
                    <p>And here it is. I wanted this post to be a introduction of sorts but it just kind of devolved into some sort of rambling that dragged on longer than I intended. Just wanted to get something done before I procrastinate myself past the point of no return.</p>
